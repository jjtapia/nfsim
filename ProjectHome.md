A general-purpose, open-source, biochemical reaction simulator with advanced capabilities for coarse-graining reaction mechanisms. NFsim implements an agent- and rule-based simulation engine that provides exact stochastic results. For many complex biological systems, NFsim provides orders of magnitude speedup over standard ODE and stochastic methods.

This repository is designed for developers of NFsim or advanced users who want direct access to the latest builds.  For end-users who will not be editing the code, please register and download a stable release of NFsim here: http://emonet.biology.yale.edu/nfsim/
