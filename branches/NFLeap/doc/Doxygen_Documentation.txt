##  NFsim Autogen Documentation with Doxygen
#####################################################
last updated 10/10/2008 by michael sneddon

NFsim was written to support automatic technical documentation using the
the freely available Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

To automatically generate documentation on NFsim, download a copy
of Doxygen from the above website, cd to the NFsim/doc directory, and
run the Doxygen program as follows:

>doxygen NF_docGenConfig



The NF_docGenConfig is the relavent configuration file that tells
Doxygen how to correctly parse the NFsim source code.  Note that to run
doxygen, you need to either provide the complete path to the Doxygen
executable, or add the Doxygen executable to your computer's Path.
Doxygen binaries are available for windows, linux, and mac, along
with source code, from the Doxygen website.  Again, for more information 
on Doxygen, see their above website.
